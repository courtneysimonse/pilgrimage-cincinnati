# Final Project Data, Topic, and Objectives
## 1. Data Source
The basis for my maps comes from the PDFs [here](https://www.pilgrimageoffaith.org/trail-maps--directions.html). I tried converting the first route, the [Cathedral Trail](/project/cathedraltrail.geojson) to a GeoJSON I may also use the parish data at http://www.catholiccincinnati.org/wp-content/themes/archdiocese/parishes/locations.xml.
## 2. Topic
My goal is to create interactive maps for use on pilgrimages planned for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati's Bicentennial.
My title will be "Archdiocese of Cincinnati Pilgrimage Trails."
## 3. Map Objectives and User Needs
* I have seen various posts on social media about these trails and they mention planning pilgrimages for a wider group of people, not just the Boy Scouts that the page originally targeted. Having interactive versions of the trails in addition to the PDFs would make the trips accessible to more people. The user could also view information on the various churches on the routes (mass times, other devotions) on the map. The information can also be more easily updated through a web map.
* Imagine Taylor decides to organize a pilgrimage for her young adult group at her parish. She isn't the best at following written directions because she always uses Google Maps navigation. She goes to the Pilgrimage of Faith website and picks out her route. She plans where the group will attend mass and go to confession along the way from the information provided. On the day of the event, she uses her phone to lead the group and check the directions. She zooms and pans to check out the route. The group is moving slower than expected, so she retrieves the information via the popups for the remaining churches to see where and when devotees are celebrating the next mass.
